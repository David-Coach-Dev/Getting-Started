### How to create a successful profile?

To create your professional profile you must identify **what you can do, what you like and what you are really good at**. Try writing a list for each of them.

Once you are clear about the things that make you stand out, you can move on to build your professional profile. Review the examples and try to build yours.

When you are building your profile you should be very descriptive in terms of experience. Do not forget to add adjectives that allow you to talk about your personality, which is also important to include. Remember that recruiters want to know about your professional experience but also how you are on a personal level.
